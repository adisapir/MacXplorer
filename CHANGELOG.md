# Change Log

## 2026-08-11 — v1.07

- Added a dedicated Copy Queue tab beside Space Analyzer, with transfer progress that continues correctly while switching tabs.
- Added Copy Queue history for completed copy and move operations, configurable under File Transfers settings and limited to the latest 100 entries by default.
- Added clickable destination-folder links to active transfers; selecting one switches to an existing folder tab or opens a new tab.
- Improved transfer cancellation and failure handling: cancelled tasks disappear immediately, progress stops correctly, unexpected abort reasons are displayed, and partial destination files are removed.
- Prioritized UI responsiveness during local and mounted-network copy and move operations by keeping filesystem work off the main thread and throttling progress updates.
- Improved deletion on network volumes by permanently deleting files when the volume does not support Trash and presenting an accurate confirmation.
- Grouped Space Analyzer and Copy Queue beneath Devices in the sidebar, while hiding the Devices section when no devices are available.
- Improved the default window layout so the current-folder path and filter controls are fully visible at launch.

## 2026-08-03 — v1.06

- Added an Appearance settings group with light, dark, and system modes; optional banded file rows; and Mac-style or Xplorer-style folder icons.
- Added app-wide element color themes: Default, 💧 Water, 🌍 Earth, 🔥 Fire, and 🌬️ Air. Themes extend across the window, title bar, tabs, sidebar, toolbars, sheets, file surfaces, Space Analyzer, and integrated terminal; Air adds a more transparent treatment.
- Improved the Settings layout with wider controls and separate Appearance, Workspace, and File Transfers groups.
- Added close controls to browser tabs and fixed sidebar sizing, selection state, and its persistent Settings/About controls.
- Remember successful server connections for quick reconnection and open connected locations in new MaXplorer tabs.
- Kept copy and move startup responsive, particularly for network destinations, by moving conflict preflight work off the main thread and coalescing progress updates.
- Refreshed README feature coverage.

## 2026-07-29 — v1.05

- Added favorites persistence and integrated favorite paths with browser tabs and file browser navigation.
- Added paste support through the tab strip and shared browser/file clipboard plumbing.
- Improved file refresh behavior after filesystem changes.
- Refined copy queue behavior for clearer progress and completion handling.
- Improved Space Analyzer tile hover tooltips so size appears first, followed by the item name and full path.
- Made About popups for README and Changelog resizable.
- Refreshed README feature coverage, including advantages over Finder.
- Improved app color scheme handling and sidebar layout polish.

## 2026-07-12 — v1.04

- Cut and paste now moves files reliably between local drives and mounted network volumes.
- Added **MaXplorer README** to the Help menu.
- The status bar shows the selected item count and total size of selected files, returning to the normal item count when the selection is cleared.
- The current folder refreshes automatically when items are added, removed, renamed, or modified externally.
- Mounted network volumes now report their available space correctly instead of showing zero bytes free.
- The integrated terminal now supports the standard Command-C and Command-V clipboard shortcuts.

## 2026-07-11

- Added integrated terminal (in addition to standard new window terminal)

## 2026-07-03 (later) — v1.02

- New **Space Analyzer** (disk storage map): a GrandPerspective-style treemap of everything under a chosen folder, opened from the sidebar, a toolbar button, a distinct coloured tab, or a folder's right-click menu. Only one analyzer tab exists at a time.
- Scanning runs fully in the background (UI stays responsive), shows live progress, has an always-visible Cancel Scan button, and keeps running when you switch tabs.
- Tiles are coloured by file category via an editable `file-categories.json` (Videos, Music, Images, Apps, Archives, Documents). Right-click a tile for Open, Browse Location, or Copy Path.
- Scans ignore symlinks and Finder aliases so only physical items are measured.
- Status bar now shows volume Used / Free (with free-space %) instead of the current folder path.
- Context menu items now display their keyboard shortcuts.
- Favorites and Network sidebar sections can be collapsed/expanded (remembered between runs).
- Long-press a file row to rename it; hover tooltips follow the cursor and dismiss on right-click.

## 2026-07-03

- Conflict resolution now works per-file: each clash shows the filename and prompts Overwrite, Overwrite All, Skip, Skip All, or Cancel. "All" variants apply to the rest of the queue without further prompts.
- Conflict resolution also applies to move operations (drag-drop onto a folder, cut-paste), not just copies.
- Duplicate Tab added (⌘⇧D).
- ⌘F focuses the filter field directly from the keyboard.
- About surface gains a README button that opens the project README in a popup, rendered with the same markdown viewer as the changelog.
- Keyboard shortcuts table in README reorganised into sections and brought up to date.
- README "Current implementation status" section replaced with a user-facing Features section.

## 2026-07-02 (later)

- Drag & drop to copy files from Finder or another tab into the current folder.
- Drag a file onto a tab to spring-load switch to it, then drop to copy in.
- Reorder folder tabs by dragging; right-click a tab for Sort by Name / Close Duplicate Tabs.
- Configurable file columns (Kind, Size, Date Modified/Created/Taken, Owner), remembered between runs; Name is always shown.
- Sidebar rows gain a modern glass hover effect; drag folders in to pin and reorder favorites.

## 2026-07-02

- Added keyboard shortcuts: Quick View (Space), Select All (⌘A), Rename (⌘⇧R); Reveal in Finder moved to ⌃⌘R.
- Fixed menu keyboard shortcuts that stayed disabled because the commands did not observe the active tab's model.
- Modernized the look and feel with Liquid Glass across the toolbar, filter field, and path bar.
- Added Settings and About surfaces to the sidebar, shown on the main canvas.
- About includes a "View Changelog" button that opens this changelog in a popup.
- Resolved all Swift 6 concurrency build warnings.
